# Money-Critical Invariant Ledger

This is the **gate list**. The bridge is releasable for real value when every invariant below is
`HELD` — enforced in code *and* pinned by an automated test that fails loudly if the property
breaks. "Confidence" is not a feeling; it is this table being green.

Tests are now **invariant-driven**: each pins a row below and asserts the *property*, not an API
shape (see [`tests/CATALOG.md`](../../tests/CATALOG.md) and [`docs/testing/README.md`](../testing/README.md)).
`make test-report` rolls every layer into this gate. Many rows are red-by-design today (KNOWN-GAP) —
that red is the worklist; a row goes green only when a tagged test holds it.

## A. Custody invariants (the ones that lose user money)

| # | Invariant | Status | Evidence / gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| **INV-1** | **No unbacked mint.** Every wrapped-token mint corresponds to a unique, chain-verified Zephyr deposit of the matching asset and amount. | HELD | Wrap amount is chain-derived ✅ (`claims/ingest.ts:108-112`); replay blocked by `usedZephyrTx` ✅. Supply invariant pinned (`Supply_TracksMintMinusBurn`, stateful fuzz) and the only supply-destroying path is `burnWithData` (emits `Burned`) — inherited `burn()`/`burnFrom()` revert (`PlainBurn_Disabled_Reverts`). Residual: signer-key compromise has no on-chain cap (contract single-key — see [key-ops-and-contract-posture.md](./key-ops-and-contract-posture.md), accepted/owner-decision). |
| **INV-2** | **No double-credit.** A single Zephyr deposit tx can never mint twice (across restarts, rescans, or token contracts). | HELD | **Same-token:** on-chain `usedZephyrTx` per token (atomic; operator + claim share the namespace) ✅, DB primary key = `bytes32(zephTxId)` ✅; pinned by forge `Claim_Replay_Reverts` / `MintFromZephyr_Replay_Reverts` / `Claim_AfterMintFromZephyr_SameTx_Reverts`. **Cross-token (HIGH-9, fixed 2026-06-10):** `usedZephyrTx` is *per token contract*, so cross-token at-most-once relies on the off-chain claim row's `token` being immutable per `zephTxId`. Now enforced — the claim-row token is frozen to the first-seen token at **all three** write sites via `resolveClaimToken`/`freezeClaimToken` (`claims/token.ts` + `claims/ingest.ts`), so `resignClaim` (`signer.ts:78`) always checks/signs the original token and a second different token can never be minted for one deposit. Justified by the protocol model — a deposit `transfer` is single-asset-typed and the claim is keyed by `bytes32(txid)`, so one-token-per-txid was already the design; the freeze drops no legitimate credit (traced & confirmed in review). Pinned by node:test `[INV-2] LB-CLAIM-TOKEN` (the HIGH-9 case asserts a differing current token never mutates the frozen token) + `[INV-2] LB-HASH-NORM`. Residual `to`/`amountWei` mutability is an INV-1 economic-field note, not a double-credit path — see FINDINGS HIGH-9. |
| **INV-3** | **No over-payout on unwrap.** The native payout never exceeds the value actually burned on-chain. | HELD | **CRIT-1** guard in place (`burnedAtomic ≥ preparedPayoutAtomic`) and pinned: `LB-AMT-COVERS`/`LB-AMT-DRAIN` (burn < prepared ⇒ no relay) + `flow_prepare_without_burn_pays_nothing` (live). Residual architectural fix (size payout *from* the burn, authenticate prepare) still recommended — see FINDINGS CRIT-1. |
| **INV-4** | **No double-payout.** A single burn event pays out at most once, even across watcher crash/restart mid-broadcast. | HELD | Every recovery path re-uses the **pre-signed payout** (fixed inputs → stable commit hash → mines at most once): `/retry` re-relays the same tx (idempotent); ingest entry-reconcile converges a re-delivered burn to the original payout. The only **fresh-input** path (`POST /admin/unwraps/:id/resend` → `zephyrTransferSimple`) is now structurally gated: it fresh-sends *only* for a burn with **no pre-signed commit in any persisted source** (row `zephTxId`/`*HashHex`, linked `ZephyrPrepared`/`ZephyrOutgoing` draft by id **and** unwrapId, or structured `burnPayload.txHash`) **and** no payout lineage **and** no lookup uncertainty — else it heals (visibly on-chain) or refuses fail-closed (409/503). `get_transfer_by_txid` -8 is treated as ambiguous (mempool ≡ never-existed), so safety is structural, not error-parsing. Pinned: `LB-RESEND` (`decideResend`, unit) + `RES-DOUBLE-PAYOUT` / `RES-RESEND-FAILCLOSED` / `RES-RESEND-DRAFT-RECOVERY` / `RES-RESEND-PAYLOAD-RECOVERY` / `RES-REINGEST` (live). Reviewed to source-enumeration convergence (HIGH-8 closed). |
| **INV-5** | **Asset-type integrity.** A ZSD deposit is credited only as wZSD (never wZEPH), and burns map to the correct native asset. | HELD | Asset→token mapping pinned per asset (`flow_wrap_asset_mints_correct_token[ZSD/ZRS/ZYS]` + ZPH, live). `transformTransfer` now **rejects** a missing/unsupported `asset_type` against `SUPPORTED_ASSET_TYPES` instead of defaulting to `"ZEPH"` (`watcher-zephyr index.ts:190`) — confirmed live that every real deposit carries an explicit V2 asset_type. Zero-amount burn rejected (`BurnWithData_ZeroAmount_Reverts`). |
| **INV-6** | **Decimal correctness.** 12-dec Zephyr atomic ↔ 12-dec wrapped token is 1:1 with no precision loss in the money direction (rounding favors the bridge, never the user-at-bridge-expense). | HELD | 1:1 confirmed and pinned: `Decimals_Is12` (forge — `decimals()==12`, not 18; a regression to 18 would mint 1e6× the intended amount) + `LB-AMT-SCALE` (node — `weiToAtomic` is 1:1 at 12-dec, scales an 18-dec token down by 1e6, and floors so rounding favors the bridge). The wei→atomic conversion lives bridge-side (`amount.ts`); the contract is a straight 12-dec ERC20. |
| **INV-7** | **Claim non-expiry trap.** A user who made a real deposit can always eventually claim it (no permanent lockout). | HELD | Admin-gated re-sign endpoint added (`POST /claims/:evm/resign`, `requireAdmin` → 403 unauth) that re-issues a fresh voucher for an expired-but-unclaimed deposit; pinned by `flow_expired_voucher_has_resign_path` (live). |

## B. Signature / replay invariants (the crypto gate)

| # | Invariant | Status | Evidence / gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| **INV-8** | **Voucher unforgeable.** Only the oracle signer can produce a valid claim; sig is bound to (to, amount, zephTxHash, deadline, this token, this chain). | HELD | EIP-712 domain w/ chainId + verifyingContract ✅ (`ZephyrWrappedToken.sol:57`); OZ 5.4 ECDSA ✅. Pinned by forge: `Claim_WrongSigner_Reverts` (non-oracle sig → `InvalidSignature`), `Claim_TamperedAmount_Reverts` / `Claim_TamperedRecipient_Reverts` (message bound), `Claim_Expired_Reverts` (deadline enforced), `SetOracleSigner_ByNonAdmin_Reverts` + `SetOracleSigner_RotationInvalidatesOldKey` (signer rotation admin-gated; rotation kills old-key vouchers — the compromise-response lever). |
| **INV-9** | **No signature replay** across tokens, chains, or repeated submission. | HELD | Domain separation + `usedZephyrTx` ✅. Pinned by forge: `Claim_CrossToken_Reverts` (wZEPH voucher rejected on a second token — `verifyingContract` binds), `Claim_CrossChain_Reverts` (same voucher on a different `chainId` rejected), `Claim_MalleableHighS_Reverts` (high-s twin rejected — OZ low-s enforcement), `Claim_Replay_Reverts` (same voucher twice blocked by `usedZephyrTx`). |
| **INV-10** | **Burn nonce non-replay.** `usedNonce[msg.sender][nonce]` blocks burn-event replay. | HELD | ✅ `ZephyrWrappedToken.sol:131-138`. Pinned by forge: `BurnWithData_NonceReplay_Reverts` (per-account nonce reuse → `NonceAlreadyUsed`) + `BurnWithData_SameNonceDifferentAccount_Allowed` (namespace is per-account, not global). |

## C. Finality / consistency invariants

| # | Invariant | Status | Evidence / gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| **INV-11** | **No payout before finality.** Burn→payout waits for an agreed EVM confirmation depth; wrap voucher invalidated if the deposit reorgs out. | HELD | `ingestEvmBurn` parks a burn shallower than `UNWRAP_RELAY_CONFIRMATIONS` (devnet=3) as `pending`; the EVM watcher's confirmation sweep (`relayConfirmedUnwraps`) relays only once buried reorg-safe deep. Burn block persisted (`Unwrap.evmBlockNumber`). Pinned: `LB-CONF-*` (depth/gate/head/cursor/reorg) + `res_unwrap_relayed_only_after_reorg_safe_depth` (live). Residuals: no Zephyr-side reorg handling after voucher signing (separate from the EVM burn gate); and the relay gate trusts `evmBlockNumber` depth without re-verifying the burn log still exists in the canonical chain after a deep reorg (refinement — devnet `confirmTarget<=0` disables the gate, so no reorgs; flagged in review 2026-06-11 while reviewing INV-12). |
| **INV-12** | **Watcher exactly-once.** Across crashes/WS-reconnects, every relevant event is processed exactly once (no missed `Burned`/`Minted`, no duplicate ingest). | HELD | The WS push is now a latency layer over a correctness-guaranteeing reconciliation sweep: every heartbeat, `reconcileEventGap` (`bridge/unwraps/backfill.ts`) re-scans `getLogs(cursor..head)` in bounded chunks (`MAX_GAPFILL_RANGE`, env-tunable) through the same idempotent handlers, so a block mined during a WS drop is recovered within a tick. The cursor is a strict contiguity watermark advanced **only** by the sweep in WS mode — the push ingests early but no longer moves it (closed a found bug where a fresh live event jumped the cursor past an un-scanned gap); a swallowed per-log ingest failure clamps the advance to `lowest-failed − 1` so the block re-scans, and a thrown handler advances nothing. Dedupe key `txHash:logIndex` (burns) / `zephTxId` (mints) on an upsert makes the overlapping re-scan a no-op (no double-ingest). Pinned by node:test `LB-GAPFILL-*` (11: range/chunk-cap, none-missed, none-doubled, watermark-clamp + no-regress, retry-on-throw, incremental catch-up). Reviewed (3 rounds: caught + fixed the cursor-jump, the swallowed-failure advance, the unbounded scan, and the WS startup double-load). Residuals (neither an INV-12 hole): concurrent WS+sweep ingest can transiently flap the ingest state-machine but self-heals via the `getTransferByTxid` reconcile with no double-pay (INV-4 territory); live fault-injection scenario RES-EXACTLY-ONCE deferred (#18). |
| **INV-13** | **Unwrap status truthfulness.** UI/API "complete" ⇔ the native payout actually landed on-chain. | HELD | The scheduled `reconcilePendingUnwraps` sweep (watcher `index.ts:320,332`) reads the **payout transfer's own mined height** via `getTransferByTxid` (not the wallet's stale internal height) and flips `pending→confirmed` once `height>0` (`reconcile.ts:81-108`, `hydrateUnwrapFromTransfer`); the INV-4 self-heal sweeps also recover in-flight/failed-after-broadcast records by commit hash. Pinned: `LB-REC-STATUS` (unit — only flips confirmed when `height>0`) + live `test_flow_unwrap_pays_out_and_status_confirms` (relay → status reaches `confirmed` in ~24s, no skip). The earlier VIOLATED state (stuck pending) predated the INV-11/INV-4 confirmation work. |

## D. Engine invariants (gate only if the engine runs against real value)

| # | Invariant | Status | Evidence / gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| **INV-14** | **Engine cannot drain inventory on a bad/stale/ manipulated price.** Armed risk limits + real slippage floor + freshness gate. | HELD | Risk controls default ON + wired into execution (`LE-RISK-DEFAULT-ON`, `LE-EXEC-RISK-WIRING`); native-oracle price-freshness signal gates auto-exec (`LE-PRICE-FRESHNESS`, `mkt_engine_tracks_native_price_freshness` live); loss breaker armed (`LE-LOSS-BREAKER`); arb detection/approval gating pinned live (`mkt_arb_detect_*`, `mkt_approval_*`). |
| **INV-15** | **Realized accounting.** Recorded PnL and the loss-tracker use *actual* fill amounts, not forecasts. | HELD | Risk wiring threads realized execution outputs into the loss tracker so the daily-loss breaker is reachable (`LE-EXEC-RISK-WIRING`, `LE-LOSS-BREAKER`, `LE-RISK-DEFAULT-ON`). |
| **INV-16** | **No fund-burning loop.** The engine cannot ping-pong wrap/unwrap (paying real fees) on accounting-only CEX legs. | HELD | `checkAccountingOnlyCexLoop` (`arbitrage.approval.ts`), wired into `shouldAutoExecute` (the autonomous-loop chokepoint), refuses a plan that pairs a real fund-moving leg with a `tradeCEX` leg whenever the CEX is accounting-only — caught via a shared `isCexAccountingOnly(mode)` predicate (single source of truth with `createMexcClient`), so it also covers `live + MEXC_PAPER` (real EVM + paper CEX), not just devnet. The engine's real CEX-close plan is `[swapEVM, tradeCEX]` (the unwrap is only inserted for a NATIVE close), so the gross-gap PnL estimate books the fake fill as real and the profit gate misses it — this guard closes it; the 60s cooldown is no longer the only brake. Manual-approval queue stays human-gated (not an autonomous loop); real-MEXC `live` passes (genuine 2-venue arb). Pinned by vitest `[INV-16]` (`tests/conformance/antiPingpong.spec.ts`, 9) grounded against the actual `buildExecutionSteps` output. Reviewed (caught + fixed a false-green where the original guard required a bridge leg + tradeCEX in one plan, which the engine never emits). |
| **INV-17** | **Execution-time gating.** Conversion availability (rrMode) and prices are re-checked at execution, not just at evaluation. | HELD | Engine gate model aligned to the protocol RR table (MINT_STABLE@400, MINT_RESERVE@800, yield-halt@200) and re-checked; the engine no longer emits a plan that closes via a daemon-rejected conversion. Pinned: `LE-CONFORM-GATES` + `mkt_gate_conform_*`, `mkt_no_doomed_plan_*`, `mkt_rrmode_*` (live). |

## E. Authorization invariants

| # | Invariant | Status | Evidence / gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| **INV-18** | **Every state-mutating privileged route requires a real auth token.** | HELD (1 accepted-risk) | Bridge `/debug/*` now `requireAdmin`-gated (401 unauth) and the destructive GET DB-reset removed (HIGH-1 closed; `sec_debug_backup_requires_auth` live). Engine `/api/engine/{runner,queue}` (toggle auto-exec; approve/reject queued ops) are **same-origin, browser-driven** (`apps/web/app/engine/page.tsx`, `'use client'`, relative `fetch`); a static bearer token would ship in the browser bundle = forgeable. **Owner decision (2026-06-10): ACCEPTED via network isolation** — engine runs operator-only behind an authenticated reverse proxy / private network (the documented testnet deployment already firewalls 7000 and does not proxy it; reach via SSH tunnel). Marked `@accepted_risk(INV-18)` (AMBER) — `sec_engine_{runner,queue}_unauth`. See [engine-deployment-posture.md](./engine-deployment-posture.md) / [key-ops-and-contract-posture.md](./key-ops-and-contract-posture.md). |
| **INV-19** | **`/unwraps/prepare` cannot be weaponized** (no unauthenticated commitment of bridge-wallet inputs / griefing). | PARTIAL | Open + unauth; even post-CRIT-1-fix it can spam prepares to contend wallet inputs (DoS). Needs auth/rate-limit. |

## How to use this ledger

1. **Pick an invariant.** Write the *negative* test first — the attack that would violate it — and
   confirm it currently fails (or, for VIOLATED rows, currently *passes the attack*).
2. **Fix the code** until the attack is blocked.
3. **Promote the row to `HELD`** only when the test is in CI and green.
4. **Release gate:** all of section A, B, C, E `HELD`; section D `HELD` *or* the engine is disabled
   for launch (documented decision).

This table — not a vibe — is the definition of "confident enough to release." See
`STATE-OF-THE-BRIDGE.md` §6 for the rolled-up checklist and `FINDINGS.md` for the fixes.
